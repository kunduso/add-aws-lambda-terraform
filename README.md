## Use Case 1: Create an AWS Lambda function using Terraform
**ðŸ”” Attention:** The code for this specific use case is located in the [`add-lambda`](https://github.com/kunduso/add-aws-lambda-terraform/tree/add-lambda) branch. Please refer to this branch instead of the default `main` branch. **ðŸ””**

This use case covers the process of creating an AWS Lambda function using Terraform. For details, please check [-create-aws-lambda-using-github-actions](https://skundunotes.com/2024/06/18/automating-aws-lambda-deployment-harnessing-terraform-github-actions-and-python-for-cloudwatch-logging/).


## Use Case 2: Securely connect an AWS Lambda to Amazon VPC
**ðŸ”” Attention:** The code for this specific use case is located in the [`add-vpc`](https://github.com/kunduso/add-aws-lambda-terraform/tree/add-vpc) branch. Please refer to this branch instead of the default `main` branch. **ðŸ””**

AWS Lambda can be connected to a custom Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Doing so, provides enhanced security by allowing cloud engineering teams to control access to resources through VPC security groups and network access control lists (ACLs). It also enables the Lambda functions to connect to private resources, such as databases and internal services, without exposing them to the public Internet. Additionally, deploying Lambda within a VPC can improve compliance with regulatory requirements by keeping data within a defined network boundary.
</br>This use case covers the process of securely connecting an AWS Lambda function to an Amazon VPC. For details, please check [-securely-connect-an-aws-lambda-to-an-amazon-vpc-using-terraform.](https://skundunotes.com/2024/11/24/securely-connect-an-aws-lambda-to-an-amazon-vpc-using-terraform/)

Additionally, this repository includes:
</br> - a [Checkov pipeline](./.github/workflows/code-scan.yml) for scanning the Terraform code for security and compliance issues.

The entire setup and deployment process is automated via the GitHub Actions pipelines, eliminating the need for manual steps.

## Prerequisites
For this code to function without errors, create an OpenID connect identity provider in Amazon Identity and Access Management that has a trust relationship with your GitHub repository. You can read about it [here](https://skundunotes.com/2023/02/28/securely-integrate-aws-credentials-with-github-actions-using-openid-connect/) to get a detailed explanation with steps.
<br />Store the `ARN` of the `IAM Role` as a GitHub secret which is referred in the `terraform.yml` file.
<br />For the **Infracost** integration, create an `INFRACOST_API_KEY` and store that as a GitHub Actions secret. You can manage the cost estimate process using a GitHub Actions variable `INFRACOST_SCAN_TYPE` where the value is either `hcl_code` or `tf_plan`, depending on the type of scan desired.
<br />You can read about that at - [integrate-Infracost-with-GitHub-Actions.](http://skundunotes.com/2023/07/17/estimate-aws-cloud-resource-cost-with-infracost-terraform-and-github-actions/)
## Usage
Ensure that the policy attached to the IAM role whose credentials are being used in this configuration has permission to create and manage all the resources that are included in this repository.
<br />Review the code including the [`terraform.yml`](./.github/workflows/terraform.ymlt) to understand the steps in the GitHub Actions pipeline. Also review the terraform code to understand all the concepts associated with creating the AWS Cloud resources..
